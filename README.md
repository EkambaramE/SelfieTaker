# SelfieTaker
Simple app to take and upload your selfies.

Choose one of following branches:
* [Without Syncano](https://github.com/lifcio/SelfieTaker/tree/without_syncano) - works offline only, lets you grab a selfie and display it on your phone
* [With Syncano](https://github.com/lifcio/SelfieTaker/tree/with_syncano) - works online and offline, lets you grab a selfie, display it on your phone AND -- send selfie to Syncano and get list of all previously taken selfies

This branch is the basic offline project, almost the same as the one without [Syncano](https://www.syncano.io).

To use version with Syncano, you will need to [sign up for an account](http://dashboard.syncano.io/#/signup) first.
